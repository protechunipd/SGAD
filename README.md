##What is this?

As the title says, it's basically a Social Game based on a Distributed Architecture.  
This project was commissioned by [FunGo Studios](http://www.fungostudios.com), but it was part of the Software Engineering teaching course held in University of Padua.

The server it's written with the Scala language, while the client is written in Javascript.

##Why so special?

One of the problems of a social game resides on the heavy usage of a database to mantain all the data always updated.  
That's why we opted for a Akka's actor based paradigm.  
What we obtained was an extremely lightweight and distributed web-based game!

It's composed of the source codes for the server, the source codes for the client and some documentation (in italian language), partially related to the teaching and not interesting by most of the users.  

The installation instructions are in the /Documenti/Manuale_Di_Installazione.pdf document.

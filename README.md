##What is this?

As the title says, it's basically a Social Game based on a Distributed Architecture.  
This project was commissioned by [FunGo Studios](http://www.fungostudios.com), but it was part of the Software Engineering teaching course held in University of Padua.

===

It's composed of the source codes for the server, the source codes for the client and some documentation (in italian language), partially related to the teaching and not interesting by most of the users.
